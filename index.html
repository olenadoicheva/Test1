Cittanova RC is a small city located in the<br> south of Italy, in the region of Calabria.</h2></font>

<font size="4" face="Helvetica"><fieldset><p>âœ¿ This is the place where I've already spent a whole year in, and staying here has brought me many memories and a chance to see lots of beautiful, and, most importantly, completely natural landscapes with my own eyes.</p></fieldset></font>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Helvetica"><center>Because I always carry my phone on me, I managed to capture some of these<br> landscapes or just in general pretty things on camera.<br> Here is a photo I took from one of many hangcliffs in Cittanova, since this city is<br> located right on the mountain rise! âœ¿</center></font><font size="+3"><center>ðŸ ®ðŸ ®ðŸ ®</center></font>
